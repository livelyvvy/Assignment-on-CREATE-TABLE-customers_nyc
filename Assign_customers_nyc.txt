QUESTIONS
Marketing Operations
You did a great job pulling data for the marketing team. However, the marketing
manager, who you so graciously helped, realized that they had made a mistake. It
turns out that instead of just the query, the manager needs to create a new table in thecompany's analytics database. Furthermore, they need to make some changes to thedata that is present in the customers table. It is your job to help the marketing managerwith the table:
1. Create a new table called customers_nyc that pulls all rows from the customers
table where the customer lives in New York City in the state of New York.
2. Delete from the new table all customers in postal code 10014. Due to local laws,
they will not be eligible for marketing.
3. Add a new text column called event.
4. Set the value of the event to thank-you party.
5. You've told the manager that you've completed these steps. He tells the marketing
operations team, who then uses the data to launch a marketing campaign. The
marketing manager thanks you and then asks you to delete the customers_nyc
table.
